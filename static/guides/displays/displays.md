Your laptop screen should appear on the TV



## Resetting Screens Once Finished

Please once you have finished with the displays, we ask that you reset them to the screensaver.

1. Change the input back to `OPS`
2. If the display is not already on the screensaver, double tap the `Screensaver` icon in the middle of the desktop
